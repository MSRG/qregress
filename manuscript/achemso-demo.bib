	abstract = {The field of quantum computing has the potential to transform quantum chemistry. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has allowed quantum computing to be applied to chemical problems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Applications of VQE have generally focused on predicting absolute energies instead of chemical properties that are relative energy differences and that are most interesting to chemists studying a chemical problem. We address this shortcoming by constructing a molecular benchmark data set in this work containing isomers of C10H16 and carbocationic rearrangements of C10H15+, calculated at a high-level of theory. Using the data set, we compared noiseless VQE simulations to conventionally performed density functional and wavefunction theory-based methods to understand the quality of results. We also investigated the effectiveness of a quantum state tomography-based error mitigation technique in applications of VQE under noise (simulated and real). Our findings reveal that the use of quantum error mitigation is crucial in the NISQ era and advantageous to yield almost noiseless quality results.},

	abstract = {In recent years, parameterized quantum circuits have been regarded as machine learning models within the framework of the hybrid quantum–classical approach. Quantum machine learning (QML) has been applied to binary classification problems and unsupervised learning. However, practical quantum application to nonlinear regression tasks has received considerably less attention. Here, we develop QML models designed for predicting the toxicity of 221 phenols on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationship. The results suggest that our data encoding enhanced by quantum entanglement provided more expressive power than the previous ones, implying that quantum correlation could be beneficial for the feature map representation of classical data. Our QML models performed significantly better than the multiple linear regression method. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that the QML models were comparable to those obtained using radial basis function networks, while improving the generalization performance. The present study implies that QML could be an alternative approach for nonlinear regression tasks such as cheminformatics.},

A quantum circuit driven by our framework learns a given task by tuning parameters implemented on it. The iterative optimization of the parameters allows us to circumvent the high-depth circuit. Theoretical investigation shows that a quantum circuit can approximate nonlinear functions, which is further confirmed by numerical simulations. Hybridizing a low-depth quantum circuit and a classical computer for machine learning, the proposed framework paves the way toward applications of near-term quantum devices for quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a PQC. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},
