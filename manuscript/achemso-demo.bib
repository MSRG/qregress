	abstract = {The field of quantum computing has the potential to transform quantum chemistry. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has allowed quantum computing to be applied to chemical problems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Applications of VQE have generally focused on predicting absolute energies instead of chemical properties that are relative energy differences and that are most interesting to chemists studying a chemical problem. We address this shortcoming by constructing a molecular benchmark data set in this work containing isomers of C10H16 and carbocationic rearrangements of C10H15+, calculated at a high-level of theory. Using the data set, we compared noiseless VQE simulations to conventionally performed density functional and wavefunction theory-based methods to understand the quality of results. We also investigated the effectiveness of a quantum state tomography-based error mitigation technique in applications of VQE under noise (simulated and real). Our findings reveal that the use of quantum error mitigation is crucial in the NISQ era and advantageous to yield almost noiseless quality results.},

Quantum machine learning (QML) has been applied to binary classification problems and unsupervised learning. However, practical quantum application to nonlinear regression tasks has received considerably less attention. Here, we develop QML models designed for predicting the toxicity of 221 phenols on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationship. The results suggest that our data encoding enhanced by quantum entanglement provided more expressive power than the previous ones, implying that quantum correlation could be beneficial for the feature map representation of classical data. Our QML models performed significantly better than the multiple linear regression method. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that the QML models were comparable to those obtained using radial basis function networks, while improving the generalization performance. The present study implies that QML could be an alternative approach for nonlinear regression tasks such as cheminformatics.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a PQC. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

In this study, we investigate several qDR techniques on a variety of datasets such as quantum Gaussian distribution adaptation (qGDA), quantum principal component analysis (qPCA), quantum linear discriminant analysis (qLDA), and quantum t-SNE (qt-SNE). The Olivetti Faces, Wine, Breast Cancer, Digits, and Iris are among the datasets used in this investigation. Through comparison evaluations against well-established classical approaches, such as classical PCA (cPCA), classical LDA (cLDA), and classical GDA (cGDA), and using well-established metrics like loss, fidelity, and processing time, the effectiveness of these techniques is assessed. The findings show that cPCA produced positive results with the lowest loss and highest fidelity when used on the Iris dataset. On the other hand, quantum uniform manifold approximation and projection (qUMAP) performs well and shows strong fidelity when tested against the Wine dataset, but ct-SNE shows mediocre performance against the Digits dataset. Isomap and locally linear embedding (LLE) function differently depending on the dataset. Notably, LLE showed the largest loss and lowest fidelity on the Olivetti Faces dataset. The hypothesis testing findings showed that the qDR strategies did not significantly outperform the classical techniques in terms of maintaining pertinent information from quantum datasets. More specifically, the outcomes of paired t-tests show that when it comes to the ability to capture complex patterns, there are no statistically significant differences between the cPCA and qPCA, the cLDA and qLDA, and the cGDA and qGDA. According to the findings of the assessments of mutual information (MI) and clustering accuracy, qPCA may be able to recognize patterns more clearly than standardized cPCA. Nevertheless, there is no discernible improvement between the qLDA and qGDA approaches and their classical counterparts.},

This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum classifier (VQC), quantum support vector classifier (QSVC), and quantum neural networks (QNN) for distinguishing transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) from transitional metal oxides (TMOs). By employing feature selection, classical machine learning achieves 100\% accuracy whereas QML achieves the highest performance of 99\% and 98\% for test and train data respectively on QSVC. Further, to extend the QML models for structural and functional analysis of materials that cannot be inferred directly from the formula, stability analysis, and magnetic nature analysis on 1000 and 500 materials are performed, respectively. The stability analysis achieves 78\% accuracy with QSVC and the magnetic nature analysis achieves 88\% with QNN establishing the competence of QML models.

Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

One conjecture relates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition function for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns approximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe that both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case complexity.

In total, the dataset consists of 4502 datapoints (1969 datapoints from the Existing and 2533 datapoints from the Hypothetical classes). The dataset covers 49 unique X-Y type single bonds (except H-H, H-F, and H-Cl), where X and Y are H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl atoms. All the reference data was calculated at the (RO)CBS-QB3 level of theory. The reference bond separation energies are non-relativistic ground-state energy differences and contain no zero-point energy corrections. This new dataset of bond separation energies (BSE49) is presented as a high-quality reference dataset for assessing and developing computational chemistry methods.},

	abstract = {Toxicity is a roadblock that prevents an inordinate number of drugs from being used in potentially life-saving applications. Deep learning provides a promising solution to finding ideal drug candidates; however, the vastness of chemical space coupled with the underlying O(n3) matrix multiplication means these efforts quickly become computationally demanding. To remedy this, we present a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for predicting drug toxicity utilizing a quantum circuit design that mimics classical neural behavior by explicitly calculating matrix products with complexity O(n2). Leveraging the Hadamard test for efficient inner product estimation rather than the conventionally used swap test, we reduce the number of qubits by half and remove the need for quantum phase estimation. Directly computing matrix products quantum mechanically allows for learnable weights to be transferred from a quantum to a classical device for further training. We apply our framework to the Tox21 data set and show that it achieves commensurate predictive accuracy to the model’s fully classical O(n3) analogue. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model continues to learn, without disruption, once transferred to a fully classical architecture. We believe that combining the quantum advantage of reduced complexity and the classical advantage of noise-free calculation will pave the way for more scalable machine learning models.},

Under the stochastic variation of the expected predicted values obtained from quantum circuits due to finite sampling, the methods proposed in previous works did not make sufficient progress in optimizing the parameters. To enable parameter optimization despite the presence of stochastic variations in the expected values, quantum circuits that improve prediction accuracy without increasing the number of parameters and parameter optimization methods that are robust to stochastic variations in the expected predicted values, were investigated. The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz circuit improved the prediction accuracy without increasing the number of parameters. The stochastic gradient descent method using the parameter-shift rule for gradient calculation was shown to be robust to sampling variability in the expected value. Finally, the quantum machine learning model was trained on an actual ion-trap quantum computer. At each optimization step, the coefficient of determination \$\$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$improved equally on the actual machine and simulator, indicating that our findings enable the training of quantum circuits on the actual quantum computer to the same extent as on the simulator.},

Existing QML models that use deep parametric quantum circuits (PQC) suffer from a large accumulation of gate errors and decoherence. To circumvent this issue, we propose a new QML architecture called QNet. QNet consists of several small quantum neural networks (QNN). Each of these smaller QNN’s can be executed on small quantum computers that dominate the NISQ-era machines. By carefully choosing the size of these QNN’s, QNet can exploit arbitrary size quantum computers to solve supervised ML tasks of any scale. It also enables heterogeneous technology integration in a single QML application. Through empirical studies, we show the trainability and generalization of QNet and the impact of various configurable variables on its performance. We compare QNet performance against existing models and discuss potential issues and design considerations. In our study, we show 43\% better accuracy on average over the existing models on noisy quantum hardware emulators. More importantly, QNet provides a blueprint to build noise-resilient QML models with a collection of small quantum neural networks with near-term noisy quantum devices.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A query-based search of various databases took place, and five different categories of algorithms were identified in which QML was implemented.

	abstract = {Molecular electronic structure theory refers to the study of the electron motion in molecules and it has become an important computational tool in chemical research. An exact solution to the full electronic Hamiltonian in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can be obtained only for hydrogenic atoms or molecular species with one electron. A variety of powerful approximate theories (configuration interaction theory, perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster theory) have been developed since the dawn of quantum mechanics. These wave function-based methods are often described as post-Hartree-Fock methods since a Hartree-Fock wave function is typically used as their starting point. However, significant computational resources are required for reaching the expected high accuracy due to exponential scaling with respect to the system size. Machine learning has been utilized as a powerful alternative for the acceleration of the convergence of the underlying equations of post-Hartree-Fock methods. Here, the recent advances in the acceleration of the coupled-cluster iterative solver through machine learning are presented. Wave function properties obtained from computationally less demanding calculations are used as input for machine learning. The data-driven coupled-cluster scheme provides the exact coupled-cluster energy because the actual iterative coupled-cluster equations are solved. Alternatively, accurate energetics can also be obtained by bypassing the explicit solution of the coupled-cluster projected equations. Our results show that remarkable speedups are achieved, especially when the physics of the electron correlation are encoded and used for training ML models. Finally, an extension of these data-driven approaches to other quantum chemical methods, such as the complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), is presented. Comprehensive examples as case studies are provided at the end of the chapter for both methods.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for learning temporal data using a parametrized quantum circuit. We use the circuit that has a similar structure as the recurrent neural network, which is one of the standard approaches employed for this type of machine learning task. Some of the qubits in the circuit are utilized for memorizing past data, while others are measured and initialized at each time step for obtaining predictions and encoding a new input datum. The proposed approach utilizes the tensor product structure to get nonlinearity with respect to the inputs. Fully controllable, ensemble quantum systems such as an NMR quantum computer are a suitable choice of an experimental platform for this proposal. We demonstrate its capability with simple numerical simulations, in which we test the proposed method for the task of predicting cosine and triangular waves and quantum spin dynamics. Finally, we analyze the dependency of its performance on the interaction strength among the qubits in numerical simulation and find that there is an appropriate range of the strength. This work provides a way to exploit complex quantum dynamics for learning temporal data.},

	abstract = {A key step in interpreting gas-phase ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data for unknown structure prediction involves identifying the most favorable protonated structure. In the gas phase, the site of protonation is determined using proton affinity (PA) measurements. Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. The result showed that this hybrid model achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.},

These equations are solved by determining the set of amplitudes (t) that minimize the system energy with respect to the coupled-cluster equations at the selected level of truncation. Here, a novel approach to predict the converged coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes, thus the coupled-cluster wave function, is explored by using machine learning and electronic structure properties inherent to the MP2 level. Features are collected from quantum chemical data, such as orbital energies, one-electron Hamiltonian, Coulomb, and exchange terms. The data-driven CCSD (DDCCSD) is not an alchemical method because the actual iterative coupled-cluster equations are solved. However, accurate energetics can also be obtained by bypassing solving the CC equations entirely. Our preliminary data show that it is possible to achieve remarkable speedups in solving the CCSD equations, especially when the correct physics are encoded and used for training of machine learning models.},

Here, we consider a very simple method that forces the bias in the expectation value to appear as a multiplicative factor that can be measured directly and removed at the cost of an increase in the sampling complexity for the observable. This method was previously discussed by Karalekas et al. [Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 024003 (2020)] for the product of single-qubit readout-error models. Here, we formally analyze the method and show that it can be applied to general noise models. In particular, we show the method does not need to assume any specific form of the noise model and requires only that the noise is “weak” to avoid excessive sampling overhead. We prove bounds relating the error in the expectation value to the sample complexity.},

The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the “X2C” approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.},

Contrary to a statement in the literature, the significant reduction in computation time realized in coupled‐cluster calculations which exploit symmetry is not due to nonlinearities in the equations. Rather, the savings of the fully vectorizable direct product decomposition (DPD) method outlined here is associated with individual (linear) contractions, and is therefore applicable to both linear and nonlinear coupled‐cluster models, as well as many body perturbation theory. In addition to the large reduction in floating point operations made possible by exploiting symmetry, core memory requirements are also reduced by a factor of ≊h2. Implementation of the method for both open and closed shells is reported. Computer timings and hardware requirements are given for several representative chemical systems. Finally, the DPD method is applied to the calculation of the equilibrium geometry, totally symmetric harmonic force field and vertical ionization potentials of the cubane molecule at the coupled‐cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) level.},
