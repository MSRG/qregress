	abstract = {The field of quantum computing has the potential to transform quantum chemistry. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has allowed quantum computing to be applied to chemical problems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Applications of VQE have generally focused on predicting absolute energies instead of chemical properties that are relative energy differences and that are most interesting to chemists studying a chemical problem. We address this shortcoming by constructing a molecular benchmark data set in this work containing isomers of C10H16 and carbocationic rearrangements of C10H15+, calculated at a high-level of theory. Using the data set, we compared noiseless VQE simulations to conventionally performed density functional and wavefunction theory-based methods to understand the quality of results. We also investigated the effectiveness of a quantum state tomography-based error mitigation technique in applications of VQE under noise (simulated and real). Our findings reveal that the use of quantum error mitigation is crucial in the NISQ era and advantageous to yield almost noiseless quality results.},

	abstract = {In recent years, parameterized quantum circuits have been regarded as machine learning models within the framework of the hybrid quantum–classical approach. Quantum machine learning (QML) has been applied to binary classification problems and unsupervised learning. However, practical quantum application to nonlinear regression tasks has received considerably less attention. Here, we develop QML models designed for predicting the toxicity of 221 phenols on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationship. The results suggest that our data encoding enhanced by quantum entanglement provided more expressive power than the previous ones, implying that quantum correlation could be beneficial for the feature map representation of classical data. Our QML models performed significantly better than the multiple linear regression method. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that the QML models were comparable to those obtained using radial basis function networks, while improving the generalization performance. The present study implies that QML could be an alternative approach for nonlinear regression tasks such as cheminformatics.},

Theoretical investigation shows that a quantum circuit can approximate nonlinear functions, which is further confirmed by numerical simulations. Hybridizing a low-depth quantum circuit and a classical computer for machine learning, the proposed framework paves the way toward applications of near-term quantum devices for quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a PQC. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},

	abstract = {Solving the coupled-cluster (CC) equations is a cost-prohibitive process that exhibits poor scaling with system size. These equations are solved by determining the set of amplitudes (t) that minimize the system energy with respect to the coupled-cluster equations at the selected level of truncation. Here, a novel approach to predict the converged coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes, thus the coupled-cluster wave function, is explored by using machine learning and electronic structure properties inherent to the MP2 level. Features are collected from quantum chemical data, such as orbital energies, one-electron Hamiltonian, Coulomb, and exchange terms. The data-driven CCSD (DDCCSD) is not an alchemical method because the actual iterative coupled-cluster equations are solved. However, accurate energetics can also be obtained by bypassing solving the CC equations entirely. Our preliminary data show that it is possible to achieve remarkable speedups in solving the CCSD equations, especially when the correct physics are encoded and used for training of machine learning models.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},
