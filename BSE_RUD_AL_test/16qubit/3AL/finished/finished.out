Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-2xzqzvee because the default path (/home/j/jacobsen/gjones/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Error.  nthreads cannot be larger than environment variable "NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS" (64)
